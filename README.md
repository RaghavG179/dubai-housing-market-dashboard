# 🏠 Dubai Housing Market Dashboard – 2025

This repository contains my Power BI dashboard project for analyzing residential housing data in Dubai. The project was completed as part of my internship at **Labmentix** and aims to provide valuable insights into pricing trends, property categories, and neighborhood patterns across 50,000 real estate listings.

## 📊 Project Objective
To build an interactive and visually informative dashboard that:
- Helps understand property prices across Dubai
- Segments listings by price range (Budget, Mid-Range, High-End)
- Analyzes patterns by neighborhood type (Urban, Suburb, Rural)
- Offers KPIs and trends useful for investors, agents, and analysts

## 🧠 Key Features
- **5 KPI Cards**: Average Price, Highest Price, Avg. Size, Total Listings, Price/Sqft
- **Bar Chart**: Distribution of listings by price category
- **Stacked Column Chart**: Bedroom count breakdown by listing type
- **Treemap**: Property size contribution by neighborhood
- **Line Chart**: Price trends based on Year Built and Area
- **Interactive Slicers**: Filter data by Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Neighborhood, Category, and Age
- **Insight Box**: Summarizes business-impactful findings

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop** for dashboard creation
- **Google Sheets / Excel** for data preprocessing
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data cleaning (in earlier EDA stage)

## 📁 Files Included
- `housing_price_dataset.csv` – Cleaned and enriched dataset
- `dashboard.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file
- `PowerBI_Dashboard_Guide_Dubai_RealEstate.docx` – Setup & design guide
- `PowerBI_Chart_Formatting_Guide.docx` – Visual formatting reference
- `video_script.md` – Script for dashboard walkthrough video

## 🚀 Insights Gained
- Urban areas dominate housing volume and pricing
- High-end listings skew heavily toward new urban developments
- Budget listings are more prevalent in suburban/rural areas
- Newer properties post-2015 command significantly higher prices
